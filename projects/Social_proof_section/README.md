## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

From this project I liked the way I used the *backgound-repeat* in order to avoid cloning the star icon in the score section of my html.

```css
.rating-stars {
    background-image: url(../images/icon-star.svg);
    background-repeat: space;
    width: 100px;
    height: 16px;
}
```

### Continued development

Positioning is one of my main focuses with CSS in this moment of my learning process, but I'm also interested on knowing other ways to use properties that were not made for that specific purpose.

### Useful resources

- [MDN - background-repeat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-repeat) - This is the documentation I used for the *background-repeat* property.
