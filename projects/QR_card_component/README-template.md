## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
This was my first challenge for frontEndMentor. My main problem was how to center the card in the viewport. I did this challenge when I was starting my web development learning so this was pretty confusing for me. At the end I did it using **flex-box**.

```css
.container {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    height: 100%;
}
```

### Continued development

This was my first step with flex-box, since then I'm in love with modern layout techniques.
