## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned
I improved my skills with flex-box in this challenge. Also experimented with the placing of svg on background.

### Continued development

I need to learn how to place svg on background instead of using a div behind everything.
