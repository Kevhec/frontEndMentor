### What I learned 👨‍🎓

This challenge is my first approach to TypeScript ☑️. I'm quite satisfied with the results and excited to learn more of this amazing tool. Many things that i've strugle on before for type issues are clear now.

### Continued development ⏲️

This was my first practical project of my typescript learning. The goal is to be familiar and comfortable with the tool so I'll be working on some more projects using it!
