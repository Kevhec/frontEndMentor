## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The design of the buttons allowed me to experiment with CSS property "*mix-blend-mode*" in order to create the **transparent text effect**.

```css
.button {
    ...
    color: black;
    mix-blend-mode: screen;
    ...
}
```

### Continued development

My goal is to become a CSS master. I want to explore more of theese tricks to create more complex layouts and styles in every step. So I will continue reading documentation about blend modes for me to get used to them and be able to apply them with a better criteria.


### Useful resources

- [css-tricks | CSS Techniques and Effects for Knockout Text](https://css-tricks.com/css-techniques-and-effects-for-knockout-text/) - This article helped me a lot with examples of *mix-blend-mode* property usage.
